# comment-remover
A python script that enables you to remove the comments in your code.

So far it can remove only //comment and /*comment*/ comments.
You can run this program by saying,

**python script.py**

and this prompts you to type the file name(along with path, if your file is not in the current working directory)

if you want to do this multiple files, you can also pass them as command line arguments.

**python script.py file1 file2 file3**

And basically thats it.

**A sidenote:** This is my first attempt of doing a small project in regex. I was watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cCaCwBKf5Y and just before the video ended, David mentioned he created something like this in his college. So this is my attempt of doing something similar. Its more like a fun project.
